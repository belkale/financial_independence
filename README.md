## Summary

1.  Use the 4% rule to identify how much you need to save for financial independence.
2.  Invest regularly considerable amount of your income.
3.  Maintain a 70:30 asset allocation. 70% of your investment in equity and rest in debt.
4.  Primarily invest in passive mutual funds.
5.  Use Google sheets to monitor your progress and manage 70:30 ratio. Also monitor your monthly expenses.

## 4% rule

You gain financial independence when your total investment is 4% of your annual expenditure.

For example, if your average monthly expenditure is 1 lakh, then your annual expenditure is 12 lakhs. So you would need an investment of 3 crores to gain financial independence as 4% of 3 crores is 12 lakhs.

Calculate your monthly expenses using Google sheets. For every bank account you have, you can maintain a table with following entries

1.  `m_b`: Money at beginning of the month
2.  `inc`: Income
3.  `inv`: Investments
4.  `m_e`: Money at end of the month

You can compute `expense = m_b + inc - inv - m_e` .

Calculate this for an year to get your annual expenditure and montly average expenditure. Calculating for an year ensures that most of your annual expenditures like school fees, trips are considered. Updating this on a monthly basis and plotting a chart helps you monitor your expenses and ensure that you are within your budget.

You can use [How much should I invest?](https://retired.re-ynd.com/how-much-should-i-invest/) calculator to determine what should be your monthly investment. For eg, you will have to invest around 1 lakh every month if your average monthly expenditure is 1 lakh and you plan to retire in 15 years.
